🎨 Color Sorting Game
Color Sorting Game is a fun and interactive puzzle game that simulates the Stack Data Structure using Python and Tkinter. Players must carefully move and sort colors in cups while following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) rule of stacks.

🎯 Why I Created This Game
This project is my final project for my 2nd-year college Data Structures and Algorithms course. It demonstrates how the stack data structure works in a real-world application through an engaging game format.

Through this project, I aimed to:
✅ Apply stack operations (push & pop) in a visual and interactive way.
✅ Improve problem-solving skills by designing a logical and fun game.
✅ Enhance my Python & Tkinter skills by building a fully functional GUI.
